##PicSpeak!
#PennApps Fall 2016 Submission

This application converts images to speech to help people with visual impairments, trouble reading non-native documents, or learning a foreign language. In order to access basic necessities in society, we often must encounter printed documents. However, not everyone has the same level of accessibility to either read or understand these important files. So one way to address this issue:

With PicSpeak, simply take a picture of any text document and wait as you hear it speak to you!

In order to build a compelling frontEnd for a wide audience, that also responds to multiple audience, the frontend application utilizes the powerful framework of React Native. This allows PicSpeak to ship as an iOS application built with JS with a simultaneous Android deployment.

The backend file conversions take place on the cloud with Node.js, Firebase, an express framework, and hosting through a Ubuntu server with Linode.

Thanks for listening, and I hope that this application can help you or someone you know!
